But here’s what’s valuable for you to notice. 중요한 포인트는 이거야.
At each point in her journey, she had to adapt and grow, 즉 매 단계마다 변화에 맞춰 성장해야 했다는 거지.
During her master’s program, Maria learned how to process complex imaging data, 복잡한 뇌 영상 데이터를 다루는 스킬을 익혔어.
At her first job in a neuroscience startup, she learned to turn those data pipelines into real diagnostic tools hospitals actually use, 병원에서 실제로 사용하는 진단 시스템으로 바꾸는 능력을 쌓았지.
And at DeepMind, she learned to bridge research and product, 그러니까 연구와 제품 개발을 연결하는 감각을 키웠어.
She turned AI models into solutions that improve patient care, 환자 치료 품질을 높이는 솔루션으로 발전시킨 거야.
The ideas we’ll cover today directly link to your coursework. 우리가 오늘 다룰 내용은 네가 배우는 과목들과 바로 연결돼.
You’re studying machine learning and data visualization, 그리고 Maria는 실제로 그 기술들을 사용해 brain scans를 분석하고 Alzheimer’s disease의 초기 징후를 감지하고 있어.

But here's what's important for you to do.
At each step, she had to grow, to change and grow.
During her Master's trial, Maria learned how to treat brain imaging data, complicated brain imaging data.
At her first job in a hospital, she learned to turn those data associations into actual diagnostic systems, which are actually used in hospitals.
And at Deep Mein, she learned to link research research to product development and product development.
She turned AI models into those curative solutions,
The ideas we'll cover today directly link to your subjects.
You're listening to learning and data detection, and Maria's actually using those techniques to analyze Brein Scans and detect the early signs of Alzheimer's rise.

About HTML index:
Didn't finish building main function (need txt to json and finish STT developing and translator fine tuning)
Can download and get authority to get sound files.
Should've build API on the backend.
